# About Me
I am studying financial mathematics and theoretical economics at Trinity University with minors in mathematics and data science. I am on track to graduate by Spring of 2027. My background includes finance, risk management, data science, and computer science. Beyond my studies, I am an interim consultant for MSInsight, a bioinformatics company headquartered in Paris, a tutor at First Generation Investors, a player on the Trinity Men's Club Volleyball team, and a member of several on-campus organizations such as Triniteers, Alpha Kappa Psi, and TU Consulting Club.

## Investing History
My investing story began with the advent of COVID-19 in the United States in early 2020. I remember watching CNBC for the first time, captivated by the news anchors nervously justifying the big red graphs pointing downwards. While I knew nothing about investing then, I created and funded my first brokerage account with $600. 

As a 16-year-old learning to invest through the internet, I inevitably began with a shaky foundation. After dabbling unsuccessfully in various short-term trading strategies for about 18 months, I purchased a copy of the _Little Book of Common Sense Investing_ by John C. Bogle. My focus later shifted to long-term and simpler strategies, exercising time-tested methods such as dollar-cost averaging with much more success.

Today, I pursue my passion for investments primarily through research, both in and out of a "research setting." During the summer of 2024, I worked as a financial research assistant at Rice University, utilizing SQL to extract financial data from Compustat and Wharton's WRDS database. We used this data combined with a synthetic control methodology to create synthetic firms and record the statistical significance of the results. On my own, I most enjoy researching and picking apart macroeconomic data, applying what I learn to evaluate the state of the broader US stock market. I intend to use my skills and experience to pursue a career in finance, consulting, actuarial sciences, or a related quantitative field.
