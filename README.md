# About Me
I am studying financial mathematics and theoretical economics at Trinity University with minors in mathematics and data science. I am on track to graduate by Spring of 2027. My backgrounds include finance, risk management, data science, and coding.

## Investing History
My investing story began with the advent of COVID-19 in the United States in early 2020. I remember watching CNBC for the first time, captivated by the news anchors nervously justifying the big red graphs pointing downwards. While I knew nothing about investing then, I created and funded my first brokerage account with $600. 

A 16-year-old learning to invest through the internet inevitably gave me a shaky start. After dabbling unsuccessfully in various short-term trading strategies for about 18 months, I purchased a copy of the _Little Book of Common Sense Investing_ by John C. Bogle. I shifted my focus to long-term investing and practiced new and simpler strategies, such as dollar-cost averaging, with much more success.

Today, I pursue my passion for investments primarily through research, both in and out of a "research setting." During the summer of 2024, I worked as a financial research assistant at Rice University, utilizing SQL to extract financial data from Compustat and Wharton's WRDS database. We used this data and a synthetic control methodology to create synthetic firms and recorded the statistical significance of the results. On my own, I enjoy researching macroeconomic data. I intend to pursue a career in finance, consulting, actuarial sciences, or a related field.
