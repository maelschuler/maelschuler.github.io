# About Me
I am studying financial mathematics and theoretical economics at Trinity University with a minor in mathematics. I am on track to graduate by the Spring of 2027. My areas of interest include finance, risk management, actuarial science, data science, and computer science. Beyond my studies, I was an interim consultant for MSInsight, a tutor and volunteer at First Generation Investors, a player on the Trinity Men's Club Volleyball team, and a member of several on-campus organizations such as Triniteers, Alpha Kappa Psi, and TU Consulting Club. These experiences have given me many new perspectives on my studies and ultimately my investment theses.

## Investing History
My investing journey began with the advent of COVID-19 in the United States in early 2020. I remember stumbling across CNBC for the first time, captivated by the news anchors nervously justifying the big red graphs pointing downwards. While I knew nothing about investing then, I immediately funded my first brokerage account with $600. 

As a 16-year-old learning to invest through the internet, I inevitably began with a shaky foundation. After dabbling unsuccessfully in various short-term trading strategies for about 18 months, I purchased a copy of the _Little Book of Common Sense Investing_ by John C. Bogle. My focus later shifted to simpler strategies with much more success.

Today, I pursue my passion for investments primarily through research, both in and out of a "research setting." During the summer of 2024, I worked as a financial research assistant at Rice University, utilizing SQL to extract financial data from Compustat and Wharton's WRDS database. We used this data, combined with a synthetic control methodology, to create synthetic firms and record the statistical significance of the results. On my own, I most enjoy researching and picking apart macroeconomic data, applying what I learn to evaluate the state of the broader US stock market. I intend to use my skills and experience to pursue a career in finance, consulting, actuarial sciences, or a related quantitative field.

# Portfolio*
*This portfolio is simulated. All gains are in paper money, but all positions and trades are according to real-time, live market data. This portfolio was incepted on October 6, 2024. The first trading day since its inception was October 10, 2024.

## Portfolio Strategy
My portfolio is to follow these guidelines:
1. No more than 75% of the portfolio can be uninvested
2. No more than 15% of the portfolio is to be invested in one security (excluding ETFs)
3. At least 5% of the portfolio must be invested in bonds/bond securities

The time horizon for most of these investments is a minimum of 4-5 months. Some holdings may be indefinite (many years). The purpose of this portfolio is for me to practice evaluating companies' "fundamentals" and, ideally, investing in undervalued firms. All positions in this portfolio are long; I do not have a reliable risk management strategy for short positions. I do not intend to use options or other derivatives in this portfolio.

I will keep an archive of all of my transactions and positions. Still, my website will only post relatively recent information (until I build a lengthy history, for which I hope to provide quarterly information).
