## Investing History

My investing story began with the advent of COVID-19 in the United States in early 2020. I remember watching CNBC for the first time, captivated by the news anchors nervously justifying the big red graphs pointing downwards. While I didn't know anything about investing at the time, I created my funded my first brokerage account with $600.
